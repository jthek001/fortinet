This articles gives the rules when creating VLAN and VDOM interface assignment

VLAN
VLANs can be created on any physical or aggregate (802.3ad)  interfaces
The same VLAN number cannot be configured twice on the same physical interface
The same VLAN number can be used on different physical interfaces
The usable VLAN ID range is from 1 to 4094

VDOM interface assignment
Two VDOMs cannot share the same interface or VLAN
A VLAN sub-interface can belong to a different VDOM than the physical interface it is attached to.


Example of VLAN setting and VDOM assignment

VDOM  "Customer1" 
physical interface port1
VLAN10_P1 (VLAN ID 10 on port1)
VLAN20_P1 (VLAN ID 20 on port1)

VDOM "Customer2"
physical interface port2
VLAN10_P2 (VLAN ID 10 on port2)

VDOM "Customer3"
