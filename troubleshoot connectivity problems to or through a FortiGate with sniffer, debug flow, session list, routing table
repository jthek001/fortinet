Description
This article describes the First steps to troubleshoot connectivity problems to or through a FortiGate.

It is also helpful to provide this diagnostic information to the Fortinet Technical Assistance Center when opening a ticket to address a connectivity issue.

Let's assume the following diagram:

[ PC1 ] ===   port1 [ FortiGate ] port2 ==== [ PC2]


Assumptions : PC1 and PC2 can be either local to port1 and port2 subnets, or on remote subnets routed via routers.
Scope
All FortiGates and FortiOS - NAT or Transparent mode.
Solution
Summary :
Step 1: Routing table check (in NAT mode)
Step 2: Verify is services are opened (if access to the FortiGate)
Step 3: Sniffer trace
Step 4: Debug flow
Step 5: Session list

Note : On FortiGate using NP2 interfaces, the traffic might be offloaded to the hardware processor, therefore changing the analysis with a sniffer trace or a debug flow as the traffic will not be seen with this procedure.  For using the sniffer and debug flow with NP2 ports, NP2 offloading must be disabled. Please refer to the related article given further below.



Step 1 : Routing table verification


If the FortiGate is running in NAT mode, verify that all desired routes are in the routing table : local subnets, default routes, specific static routes, dynamic routing protocol.
The Fortigate will drop packets in case of RPF check failure (see related article at the end of this page  Details about RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding), also called Anti Spoofing, on FortiOS )


To verify the routing table, use the CLI command "get router info routing-table all" as per the example below :

FGT# get router info routing-table all

Codes: K - kernel, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, B - BGP
       O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area
       N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2
       E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2
       i - IS-IS, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2, ia - IS-IS inter area
       * - candidate default

S*      0.0.0.0/0 [10/0] via 192.168.183.254, port1, [0/50]
C       10.0.0.0/24 is directly connected, VLAN_on_port1
C       10.160.0.0/23 is directly connected, port2
C       12.0.0.0/24 is directly connected, port1
C       172.16.78.0/24 is directly connected, VLAN_on_port3
C       192.168.182.0/23 is directly connected, port1 





Step 2 : Verify if services are opened on the port (if accessing to the FortiGate itself)


2.1 - Verify that all appropriate services are opened on the interface that is being access (telnet, http...)

Example : 

FGT # show system interface port1
config system interface
    edit "port1"
        set vdom "root"
        set ip 192.168.182.108 255.255.254.0
        set allowaccess ping https ssh http telnet
        set type physical
    next
end


2.2 - If the interface is accessed via another port of the FortiGate, a firewall policy must exist to allow this traffic

Example : 

config firewall policy
    edit 1
        set srcintf "port1"
        set dstintf "port2"
            set srcaddr "all"
            set dstaddr "all"
        set action accept
        set schedule "always"
            set service "ANY"
    next




Step 3: Sniffer trace


Take a sniffer trace as per the following examples when running a constant ping (or TCP connection) from PC1 to PC2.
This will answer the following questions:
- Is traffic arriving to the FortiGate and does it arrive on the expected port?
- Is the ARP resolution correct for the targeted next-hop?
- Is the traffic exiting the FortiGate to the destination?
- Is the traffic sent back to the source?


FGT# diagnose sniffer packet any "host <PC1> and host <PC2>" 4
or
FGT# diagnose sniffer packet any "(host <PC1> and host <PC2>) and icmp" 4

Including the ARP protocol in the filter may be useful to troubleshoot a failure in the ARP resolution (for instance PC2 may be down and not responding to the FortiGate ARP requests)

FGT# diagnose sniffer packet any "host <PC1> and host <PC2> or arp" 4

To stop the sniffer, type CTRL+C.

With verbosity 4 above, the sniffer trace will display the port names where traffic ingresses/egresses.



Step 4: Debug flow


Traffic should come in and leave the FortiGate. If not, proceed with a debug flow as follows:

diag debug enable
diag debug flow filter add <PC1>    or    diag debug flow filter add <PC2>
diag debug flow show console enable
diag debug flow trace start 100          <== this will display 100 packets for this flow
diag debug enable

To stop all other debug, type "diag debug flow trace stop".


Examples of results that may be obtained from a debug flow :

3.1 - The following is an example of debug flow output for traffic that has got no matching Firewall Policy, hence blocked by the FortiGate :


id=20085 trace_id=319 func=resolve_ip_tuple_fast line=2825 msg="vd-root received a packet(proto=6, 192.168.129.136:2854->192.168.96.153:1863) from port3."
id=20085 trace_id=319 func=resolve_ip_tuple line=2924 msg="allocate a new session-013004ac"
id=20085 trace_id=319 func=vf_ip4_route_input line=1597 msg="find a route: gw-192.168.150.129 via port1"
id=20085 trace_id=319 func=fw_forward_handler line=248 msg=" Denied by forward policy check"


3.2 - The following is an example of debug flow output for traffic going into an IPSec tunnel in Policy based. This is a working scenario. See traffic is matching and  processed by Firewall Policy #2



id=20085 trace_id=1 msg="vd-root received a packet (proto=1, 10.72.55.240:1->10.71.55.10:8) from internal."
id=20085 trace_id=1 msg="allocate a new session-00001cd3"
id=20085 trace_id=1 msg="find a route: gw-192.168.56.230 via wan1"
id=20085 trace_id=1 msg="Allowed by Policy-2: encrypt"
id=20085 trace_id=1 msg="enter IPsec tunnel-RemotePhase1"
id=20085 trace_id=1 msg="encrypted, and send to 192.168.225.22 with source 192.168.56.226"
id=20085 trace_id=1 msg="send to 192.168.56.230 via intf-wan1“
id=20085 trace_id=2 msg="vd-root received a packet (proto=1, 10.72.55.240:1-10.71.55.10:8) from internal."
id=20085 trace_id=2 msg="Find an existing session, id-00001cd3, original direction"
id=20085 trace_id=2 msg="enter IPsec ="encrypted, and send to 192.168.225.22 with source 192.168.56.226“ tunnel-RemotePhase1"
id=20085 trace_id=2 msgid=20085 trace_id=2 msg="send to 192.168.56.230 via intf-wan1"



Other information messages are explained in the article "Troubleshooting Tip : debug flow messages "iprope_in_check() check failed, drop" - "Denied by forward policy check" - "reverse path check fail, drop"




Step 5: Session list


One further step is to look at the firewall session. For this, some filters may be used to reduce the output; see the following example:

diag sys session filter src PC1
diag sys session list 
or 
diag sys session filter dst PC1
diag sys session list 

The analysis of the output of this command  is further detailed in the related article below  (FortiGate Firewall session list information )


To clear all sessions corresponding to a filter:

diag sys session filter dst PC1
diag sys session clear
